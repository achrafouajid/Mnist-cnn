# ðŸ§  MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition API

A lightweight Flask API for recognizing handwritten digits (0â€“9) drawn on a phone, tablet, or web canvas.  
The model is trained on the MNIST dataset using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and enhanced preprocessing to handle **real-world, thick-stroke digits** drawn by users.
